# BankingApplication-fe

## Getting the repository

Make sure you have git installed and run this command to get the front end application:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hegde-atri/BankingApplication-fe.git
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 You need to have node.js and NPM installed!
{% endhint %}

Once you have cloned the directory:

```text
$ cd BankingApplication-fe
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The default address is localhost:4200
{% endhint %}

That is basically how you would host this application. If you want to develop angular applications, you can install angular globally on your machine using the command.

```text
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```
